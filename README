mailpie - e-mail full text search


REQUIREMENTS

- python  (tested with python 2.4.3 and 2.5.2)
- swish-e (tested with swish-e 2.4.3 and 2.4.5)

mailpie is developed on Linux systems.


INSTALLATION

Site-wide installation:
    $ sudo python setup.py install

Personal installation:
    $ python setup.py install --home=$HOME
Make sure that $HOME/lib/python is on PYTHONPATH

See distutils documentation for more installation options.


USAGE

To add a mailbox full of messages to the mailpie storage:
    mailpie-add example.mbox

To search for messages:
    mailpie-search from=jepler
Available search tags are:
    subject from to cc bcc list-id message-id date header
without a tag, the message headers and body are all searched.

To rebuild the index from scratch (e.g., in case of an aborted
mailpie-add):
    mailpie-index

For more information on commandline options, see mailpie-xxx --help.


REMOVING MESSAGES

There is no provision for removing messages from a mailpie storage area
or from the index.


TIPS

Because swish-e can take a long time to merge two index files together,
wait until you have many messages before running it.  For instance, use
a cron job to add a full day's messages in a single operation.
